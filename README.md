# Twitter-data-pipeline
Excited to share my latest project: Building a data pipeline for Twitter using Airflow, Python, &amp; AWS (S3 &amp; EC2)!  A powerful combo for collecting &amp; analyzing Twitter data.

## Description

In this project, I explored building a data pipeline for Twitter data using the following technologies:

 **AWS Cloud:**  Utilized S3 buckets for storage and EC2 instances for running Apache Airflow.

**Apache Airflow:** Orchestrated the data pipeline with Twitter-specific DAGs.

**Python:** Developed scripts to extract data from the Twitter API and perform transformations.



## Key Steps

**1. Twitter API:** Downloaded and integrated the Twitter API for data extraction.

**2. Python Program:** Wrote Python code to pull relevant Twitter data.

**3. Airflow DAGs:** Defined DAGs within Airflow to manage the pipeline flow.

**4. EC2 Instance:** Launched an EC2 instance with Airflow, pandas, and other dependencies.

**5. Tweet File Analysis:** Extracted and processed tweets for further analysis.

**6. S3 Storage:** Stored the final CSV file in an S3 bucket for persistent storage.



## Overall, this project showcases my ability to

Work with cloud technologies like AWS S3 and EC2.

Utilize Apache Airflow for data pipeline orchestration.

Develop Python scripts for data extraction and transformation.

Analyze and store Twitter data effectively.


**When we run the EC2 instance this are the command to be excited in terminal**
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip install apache-airflow
sudo pip install pandas 
sudo pip install s3fs
sudo pip install tweepy
